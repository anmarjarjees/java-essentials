/*
 * Data Structures:
 * > In any Programming Language
 * > Containers that is used for storing, accessing, and arrange data o multiple values
 * > Can have simple and complex forms
 * 
 * Examples/Types of some of the commonly used:
 * Array
 * List => Array List and Linked List
 * HashMap
 * Queue
 * Stack 
 * Heap
 * 
 * Arrays are special variables for containing multiple values
 * Instead of many variable for saving multiple values
 * we can have one variable for saving multiple values
 *  
 * DataType[] variableName = new DataType[x]
 * where x is the number of the values inside the array and it's FIXED (no more no less) 
 * so x represents the length of the array
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * All values in the array must be of the same data type (Remember Java is a strongly data type)

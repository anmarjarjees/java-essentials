 * "private", "public", "protected", and "default" called "Access Modifiers" also called "Visibility Modifiers"
 * 
 * NOTE#1: 
 * This class doesn't have a main method, 
 * as we are not intended to execute any of the method
 * within the class itself!
 * We just want to build it as "Blueprint" for other objects
 * or it is called a "General Representation"
 * 
 * NOTE#2: 
 * When creating a class in JavaScript:
 * - Adding "public" to make accessible everywhere and this is the way to go with almost all the time
 * - We cannot use "private" or "protected" for a class definition, these modifiers can be used for the class' members
 * - If you don't use "public" and leave it empty, Java will use the "default" access modifier

public class Rectangle {
    /*
     * Declaring the global variable of an object:
     * Inside an object (class) these variables are called "fields"
     * 
     * A rectangle can have a length and width
     * 
     * If a class has no modifier (the default, also known as package-private),
     * it is visible only within its own package (packages are named groups of
     * related classes)
     * Link:
     * 
     * public fields are AGAINST encapsulations
     * so we should make them private:
     * - public: Any other class or instance of that class can access this public
     * field/method
     * - private: this private field/method can be accessed by by the same class or
     * within the class itself
     * 
     * Encapsulation: specifies that:
     * - the data of a class which are fields should be "private"
     * - the behaviour of a class which are methods can be "public" to its
     * instances/objects or other classes
     * 
     * NOTE:
     * We cannot add the keywords "protected", "private" access modifiers to classes
     * or interfaces.
     * we will have this error: "Default methods are allowed only in interfaces"
     * As the error indicates, the keyword "default" can be used only with
     * interfaces
     * (Interfaces will be covered later...)
     * So in case no "private", "public", "protected" keyword is added
     * Java will implicitly use the "default" modifier but we CANNOT type the
     * keyword "default".
     * Creating a class without any access modifier, Java will set it to "default"
     * 
     * Example:
     * This class is accessible by all the classes inside its package
     * but it is not accessible from outside this package,
     * and the same rule for default field/method are also accessible inside the
     * package
     * 
     * class Circle {
     * // field
     * // behaviour
     * }
     *
     * 
     * These modifiers can used to set the visibility of or determine how to access
     * the:
     * - data (filed)
     * - methods
     * - Class constructor
     * - and the class itself
     * 
     * "default" =>
     * "protected" => only other classes within the same package that inherit from
     * the current class can access it (notice that protected field cannot be
     * accessed by an object)
